# Breakout - A Raylib Project
This is the next step in my game development journey after my initial game - [Pong using Pygame](https://github.com/cesarpmorais/Pong-Pygame/tree/main).

Learning Raylib was my main goal, but I was also interested in providing clean code, and familiarizing myself with an organized file system.

### How to Run It
From the root folder, compile using
```make```

To run the game itself:
```./bin/breakout```

Raylib must be installed for it to compile.

### To-do
- __Game Screens__: Start Screen/Game Over/Game Completed;
- __Improve Gameplay Experience__: Speed increase and direction changes could use some fine-tuning.
